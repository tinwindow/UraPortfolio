<p>Hi, my name is Erin, aka Tinwindow.  I'm creating this short bio as part of my first 
lab at Grand Circus.  My interests include cycling, making music and video art, writing poetry,
and being in a constant state of learning and growth! I've included links to some work I've done at the top of this page.</p>
